You can view games in Dr.Racket program and Advanced Student language also you have to apply necesarry teachpacks (universe,image,batch-io).
These games are gived to us by our university.
We designed games topics and subjects.
We decided algortihms, data types and program languages are the most fundemental topics for programming and firstly they are teached to elementary school children.
It was a group project, Ismail Yigit Kaya and Aybuke Nur Yilmaz were my team friends.
